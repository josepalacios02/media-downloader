## 🔑 Configure API Key (Required for Image Downloads)

> 💡 **Note**: If you only need to download YouTube videos, you can skip this step!

Image downloads require a free API Key (like a "membership card" for stock photo sites):

1. Go to **https://www.pexels.com**, click **Join** to register (Google/Apple quick signup supported)
2. After signup, visit **https://www.pexels.com/api/**, click **Your API Key**
3. Copy the key, then tell Claude: **"Help me save my Pexels API Key to environment variables"**

When done, tell Claude **"Check the status of media-downloader"** to confirm everything is working.

---

## 📋 More API Keys (Optional)

> 💡 **Why do I need API Keys?**
>
> Think of an API Key as a "membership card" for stock photo websites. With it, you can search and download HD images and videos.
>
> **Good news**: Registration is completely free, and all assets are free for commercial use!

The quick install above only configured Pexels. If you want more image sources, you can register for these:

### 🟢 Pixabay (More Assets)

1. Go to **https://pixabay.com**
2. Click **Join** in the top right corner
3. After signup, visit **https://pixabay.com/api/docs/**
4. Your API Key will be displayed right on the page (in the green box)
5. Tell Claude: **"Help me save my Pixabay API Key to environment variables"**, then paste your key

### 🔵 Unsplash (More Artistic Images)

1. Go to **https://unsplash.com/developers**
2. Click **Register as a developer**
3. Create an Application (just give it any name)
4. Find and copy the **Access Key**
5. Tell Claude: **"Help me save my Unsplash API Key to environment variables"**

### 🔧 Having Issues?

Tell Claude: **"Check the status of media-downloader"**

Claude will tell you which tools are installed and which API Keys are configured. Just fix what's missing!

## 💬 Usage Examples

> ⚠️ **Important**: Before using, tell Claude **"Check the status of media-downloader"** to make sure all dependencies are installed!

### Download Images

```
"Download 5 starry sky images"
"Download 10 coffee shop photos"
"Find some landscape images suitable for wallpapers"
```

### Download Videos

> 💡 **Recommended**: If you need to download videos, **use YouTube first**! YouTube has rich content, high quality, and doesn't require an extra API Key.

```

"Download minute 2 to minute 3 of this YouTube video"
"Only download the audio from this video"
```

If you need short video clips from stock libraries:

```

```

## 📁 Download Location

By default, all files are saved to:

```
~/.claude/skills/media-downloader/downloads/
```

### Custom Download Directory

You can specify a custom download location using the `-o` or `--output` option:

```bash
# Download images to a specific folder
media_cli.py image "cats" -o ~/Pictures/cats

# Download videos to Desktop
media_cli.py video "sunset" -o ~/Desktop

# Download YouTube video to current directory
media_cli.py youtube "URL" -o .
```

Or simply tell me where you want the files:

```
"Download 5 cat images to my Desktop"
"Save the video to ~/Videos/project"
```

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: YouTube says "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot"?

This is YouTube's anti-bot mechanism. The solution is to let yt-dlp use your browser's login session:

**Method 1: Tell Claude (Recommended)**

> **"Help me configure yt-dlp to use browser cookies"**

Claude will set it up for you.

**Method 2: Manual Configuration**

1. Make sure you're logged into YouTube in your browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
2. Add `--cookies-from-browser chrome` when downloading:

```bash
yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser chrome "YouTube_URL"
```

> 💡 **Tip**: Replace `chrome` with your browser: `firefox`, `edge`, `safari`, `brave`, etc.

### Q: Why are there no image search results?
A: Please confirm API Key is configured. Run `status` command to check configuration status.

### Q: YouTube video download failed?
A: YouTube download doesn't need an API Key, but requires yt-dlp. Run `pip install yt-dlp` to install.

### Q: Video trimming doesn't work?
A: ffmpeg is required. macOS users run `brew install ffmpeg`.

### Q: Can these images/videos be used commercially?
A: Assets from Pexels, Pixabay, and Unsplash can all be used commercially for free, no attribution required (though attribution is appreciated).
